Rihtan programming language
Copyright 2015, 2016 William Carney

The Rihtan project includes the design of the Rihtan language,
a compiler that translates Rihtan source to C source,
some Rihtan packages for use in Rihtan programs, a set of
sample programs, documentation, and a program to extract
subsets of source files.
